     You might be tempted to choose distinctive fixtures for your bathroom, but this isn’t the most economical option. Jake Romano, who works for Ottawa-based plumbing company John The Plumber, said things like unique shower valves and faucets might look beautiful and interesting, but they can be pricey.

“These fixtures don’t last forever, and they often need replacement parts like cartridges,” he said. “Replacement parts are not standardized. If you buy an extremely unique fixture from a relatively unknown brand, you’re going to have a difficult time finding replacement parts.”

Opting for standard fixtures might not seem as fun, but you’ll likely be glad you did.

“If you buy a fixture from a popular brand like Moen or Delta, you’ll likely be able to get a replacement part the same day you need it,” he said.

You can’t put a price on the value of having a fully functioning bathroom at all times.n
